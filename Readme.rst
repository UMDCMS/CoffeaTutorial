COFFEA Tutorial
====================

Welcome to the COFFEA tutorial, written by the CMS analysis group at the
University of Maryland, College Park! This set of documentations aims to help
people coming for a traditional C++/python event loop based analysis work flow
get started with the concepts and tools used in coffea_, a new analysis framework
based around array manipulation. While having overlaps with the official
documentation, this tutorial provides more introductory material and examples
that doesn't fit with typical documentation formats, as well as provide concrete
snippets picked up by the team at UMD during analysis using coffea, to help
people who are struggling with the new syntax to use as guidelines as to how to
get started writing their own analysis code with coffea and similar tools.

We will point extensively to the official documentation whenever possible, but
the reading here should be nearly standalone, enough for beginners to get
started, while providing adequate information for the more advanced user to find
the information they need. The order of the tutorial will roughly be in the order
that is typically needed for a new comer to get started.
