In a sense, the `events`, `Electron` and `pt` variables are just a easy way for represting the final `NxA` array that we might be intested in for the analysis. In our case the `N` number of events is whatis called as the outer most **dimension** or axis of the various objects, `A` is the one inner dimesion of the of array. `K` is not a true dimesion in the sense it can be though of a book keeping object used to keep track of how many awkward arrays are present, so in this sense, we can say the the `events.Electron` is a `NxA` object/collection array, as opposed to the `events.Electron.pt` being a `NxA` data array.\n",

The addition of collections looks very straight forward, one can think of the `events` as something that looks like a \"dictionary of collection with a common outer dimension\", so the addition of the two electron collections to the event has a very distionary-esque notation. What is strange is the persistence of the extended collection for the electrons. Logically, the operation looks identical, but the first attempt to add the new variable `invpt` directly to `events.Electron` fails to persist, and thus all direct extensions of `events.Electron` doesn't include the new `invpt` field. \n",

The rule-of-thumb is that collections that are directly generated from the file, (a.k.a. the collections directly obtained listed the `events.fields` immediate after opening a file) can **never** be altered, and therefore cannot have extended variables added to them. To create an extended variable to some collection, we will need to make some sort of copy of the original either by some trivial kinematic selection (ex. `myElectrons = events.Electrons[events.Electrons.pt > 0]`) or some trivial splicing (`myElectrons = events.Electrons[:]`). Another feature of mutability is that once the collection is added to the event collection, it becomes immutable. That is why the third attempt is the one that adds the both the electron extended variable and the extednded electron collection to the event.\n",
